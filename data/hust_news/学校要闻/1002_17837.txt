 题目：娱乐活动多种多样，娱乐好处危害，大学生怎么办?
        Among various recipes one enjoys in his or her college life, recreational activities can by no means be ignored. It is numerous activities, such as spoken English competitions, sports events, and clubs and societies of different interests, that help to make campus life colorful and diversified.
  　Facing so many interesting extracurricular activities, we college students have trouble to choose the proper ones. As freshmen, we are confused by all kinds of posters for students’ clubs to recruit new members. There are two opposite views about recreational activities. One says they exert positive influence on a student’s physical and mental development, for they can explore a student’s talent, develop a student's ability in communication, and teach them to be more independent. While, opposite voices can also be heard by asserting that recreational activities waste too much time, and therefore may hinder student from focusing on his or her study.
   As for me, I hold a belief that recreational activities do more good than harm, because I have always been of the impression that as a college student, he or she, besides the academic information, should pick up more practical skills to be better prepared for the career development. Recreational activities do give us a good chance. And, so long as one can arrange the time by reason, activities besides study will definitely provide more benefit for us.

Passage one: TIME
I think a lot about time and not just because it’s the name of the news organization I work for. Like most working people, I find time or the lack of it, are never ending frustration and an unwinable battle. My every day is a race against the clock that I never ever seem to win. This is hardly a lonesome complaint, according to the families and work institutes, national study of the changing work force. 55% of the employees say they don’t have enough time for themselves, 63% don’t have enough time for their spouses or partners, and 67% don’t have enough time for their children. It’s also not a new complaint. I bet our ancestors returned home from hunting wild animals and gathering nuts, and complained about how little time they had to paint battle scenes on their cave walls. The differences about the boresome animal hunting and ahead of not gathering probably told them to shut up or no survival for you. Today’s workers are still demanding control over their time, the differences today’s bosses are listening. I’ve been reading your report issued today called when work works, produced jointly by 3 organizations. They set out to find and warn the employers who employ the most creative and most effective ways to give their workers flexibility. I found this report worth reading and suggest every boss should read it for ideas. 
               26. What is the speaker complaining about?
              27. What does the speaker say about our ancestors? 
               28  . Why does the speaker suggest all the bosses read the report by the 3 organizations? 
       Passage 2
        Loving a child is a circular business. The more you give, the more you get. The more you want to give, Penalaeone said. What she said proves to be true of my blended family. I was born in 1931as the youngest of 6 children, I learn to share my parents’ love. Raising 6 children during the difficult time of the Great Depression took its toll on my parents’ relationship and resulted in their divorce when I was 18 years old. Daddy never had very close relationship with his children and drifted even farther away from us after the divorce. Several years later, a wonderful woman came into his life, and they were married. She had 2 sons. One of them is still at home. Under her influence we became a blended family and a good relationship developed between the 2 families. She always treated us as if we were her own children. It was because of our other mother, daddy’s second wife, that he became closer to his own children. They shared over 25 years together before our father passed away. At the time of his death, the question came up of my mother, daddy’s first wife, attending his funeral. I will never forget the unconditional love shown by my stepmother. When I asked her if she would object mother attending daddy’s funeral. Without giving it a second thought, she immediately replied, “of course not honey, she is the mother of my children.” 
            29. According to the speaker, what contributed to her parents’ divorce? 
             30 . What brought his father closer to his children?
             31 What message does the speaker want to convey in this talk? 
Passage 3 In February last year, my wife lost her job.
Just as suddenly, the owner of the greenhouse where I worked as manager died of heart attack. His family announced that they were going to close the business because no one in the family wanted to run it. Things looked pretty gloomy, my wife and I read the want-ads each day. Then one morning, as I was hanging up a Going Out the Business sign at greenhouse, the door opened and in walked a customer. She was an office manager whose company has just moved into the new office park on the edge of town. She was looking for parted plants to place in the reception areas and offices. "I don't know anything about plants," she said. "I'm sure in a few weeks that all be dead." Why I was helping her select her purchases? My mind was racing. Perhaps as many as a dozen firms had recently opened offices in the new office park and there were several hundred more acres with construction under way. That afternoon, I drove out to the office park. By six o'clock that evening I had signed contracts with seven companies to rent plants from me and pay me a fee to maintain them. Within a week, I had worked out an agreement to lease the greenhouse from the owner's family. Business is now increasing rapidly. And one day, we hope to be the proud owners of the greenhouse.
32．What do we learn about the greenhouse?
       33. What was the speaker doing when the customer walked in one morning? 
       34 ．What did the speaker think of when serving the office manager?
       35What was the speaker’s hope for the future?
